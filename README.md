# Mini-DBMS
Designed and built a DBMS which could provide 
Persistent data management: Persistent data management requires that data as well as schemas in databases be retained in disks after the program terminates. Thus, any changes to data and databases schemas must eventually be committed to disks.
A SQL interpreter/Commands: The SQL interpreter should be able to parse and execute basic SQL commands (a subset of the SQL command set), provide integrity checking,cost estimation, and print out appropriate error messages in case errors are involved in the SQL commands.
